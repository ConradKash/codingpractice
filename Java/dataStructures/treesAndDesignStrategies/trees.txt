The depthFirstTraversal method performs a depth-first traversal of the tree. 
It starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 
The traversal stops when it reaches the specified level.

The breadthFirstTraversal method performs a breadth-first traversal of the tree. 
It starts at the root and explores all the nodes at the current level before moving to the next level. 
The traversal stops when it reaches the specified level.

Depth-first traversal, as mentioned above, starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 
This approach is similar to backtracking, where you explore a solution space by trying out different paths and backtracking when a dead end is reached. 
Depth-first traversal can be used as a strategy within a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible solutions.

On the other hand, breadth-first traversal explores all the nodes at the current level before moving to the next level. 
This approach is similar to the branch and bound technique, where you systematically explore all possible branches of a problem and bound the search space based on certain criteria. 
Breadth-first traversal can be used as a strategy within a branch and bound algorithm to explore the search space in a systematic manner.
