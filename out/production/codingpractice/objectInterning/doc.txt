Object interning refers to the process of storing a single copy of an object in 
memory and reusing it whenever it is needed and it is applied to Strings using the
String.intern() method/ 

When it is added to the string pool if it doesnt already exist. the coming references to the 
same string literal will then return the interned instance from the pool other thann creating
a new object.

It can be used in many ways like
1. Memory optimization: by reusing interned objects, memory consuption is reduced
2.String Equity: Interned Strings can be compared for equality using reference 
comparison (==) other than value comparison (equals()) this improves performance
3.Caching: If you have a set of predefined constant used frequently, intern can 
improve performance by reducing unecessary object creation.
